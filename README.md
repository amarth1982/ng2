# ng2

A sample starter application to describe various angular2 features ( I am using angular2 alpha 37)

  - angular2 library is build to ng2.alpha.37.js using jspm, systemjs builder
  - Used typescript for implementation, but you should be able to see the js version of the file too
  - Using systemjs to build the ts files and run the application in the browser


I am still learning an working on it, will keep updating whatever I find.
