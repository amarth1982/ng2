# ng2

A sample starter application to describe various angular2 features ( I am using angular2 alpha 37)

  - angular2 library is build to ng2.alpha.37.js using jspm, systemjs builder
  - Used typescript for implementation, but you should be able to see the js version of the file too
  - Using systemjs to build the ts files and run the application in the browser


1. Components
2. Routing
3. NgFor, NgIf
4. Defining element variable in the DOM and using it
5. Shadow DOM Creation - View Encapsulation

I am still learning and working on it, will keep updating whatever I find.
